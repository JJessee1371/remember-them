        <blockquote>
            This website was conceived by four web development students fulfilling, three of whom are 
            veterans (two Army and one Marine). The initial idea was to create a tribute page to fallen 
            Navy SEALs; this idea has since extended to all of the service branches.

            The purpose of this site is to provide visitors a place to learn, research, and pay tribute
            to those men and women who have sacrificed themselves for their country. We thank you for 
            your interest in this site. We welcome your feedback on how to make this page better.

            Sincerely,

        </blockquote>
